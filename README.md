The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, 
being knowledgeable and having a decent standard of living. 
The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions12. It is used to rank countries into four tiers of human development1.
